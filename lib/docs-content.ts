## About Rory Skagen

Rory Skagen is an acclaimed American painter and muralist whose hyper-graphic, saturated works have shaped the visual identity of Austin, Texas for more than three decades. Blending **mid-century retro-futurism, roadside commercial Americana, giant kaiju creatures, and whimsical pop surrealism**, Skagen's canvases celebrate the golden age of American design with a modern, subversive twist.

---

## Greetings from Austin Mural

Painted in 1998 on the side of Roadside Relics on South 1st Street, the **"Greetings from Austin"** mural is one of the most recognizable and photographed public art landmarks in Texas. Modeled after vintage 1940s Curt Teich linen postcards, the mural features the Capitol dome, Congress Avenue bridge bats, and Texas longhorns framed inside 3D block lettering.

In our Fourthwall store, this iconic mural has been carefully preserved from high-resolution archival scans and reproduced as museum-grade fine art prints and gallery-wrapped canvases.

---

## The Artistic Universe

Rory Skagen’s expansive body of work is organized into four signature thematic movements:

1. **Austin Iconic & Texas Pop**: Austin landmark skyline art, vintage Texas motel signs, and roadside nostalgia.
2. **Monsters & Kaiju**: Dynamic confrontations between atomic-era giant creatures, robots, and surreal beasts (*Gianondor*, *Empopatya*, *Gaurdon*).
3. **Pop Surrealism & Folklore**: Whimsical storytelling, eccentric mid-century Americana, and surreal character portraits (*The Persistence of Cats*, *The Martian*).
4. **Atomic Pop & Sci-Fi**: Space-age exploration, rocket cruisers, retro robots, and neon ephemera.

---

## The Studio’s Mission

Through our Fourthwall partnership, the studio delivers authentic, premium-quality archival art directly to collectors worldwide, backed by secure global fulfillment and certified studio provenance.

## Server vs Client Component Boundary

In accordance with Next.js 15 architectural best practices:

- **Server Components (Default):**
  - \`app/[currency]/page.tsx\`
  - \`app/[currency]/product/[handle]/page.tsx\`
  - \`components/grid/three-items.tsx\`
  - \`components/carousel.tsx\`
  - \`app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\`
  - Benefits: Zero client-side JavaScript overhead for catalog data, superior SEO, fast TTFB.

- **Client Components (\`'use client'\`):**
  - \`components/cart/modal.tsx\` (interactive cart drawer)
  - \`components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx\` (optimistic variant selection)
  - \`app/import/page.tsx\` (real-time sync dashboard with terminal output)
  - \`components/layout/navbar/currency.tsx\` (currency switching dropdown)

---

## Caching & ISR Strategy

Next.js 15 caching primitives are configured for high-traffic scalability:

\`\`\`ts
// lib/fourthwall/index.ts
export async function getCollectionProducts({ collection, currency, limit }) {
  const res = await fourthwallGet(
    \`\${API_URL}/collections/\${collection}/products\`,
    { currency, limit },
    { next: { revalidate: 3600, tags: [\`collection-\${collection}\`] } }
  );
  return reshapeProducts(res.body.results);

## Data Reshaping Pipeline

Raw Fourthwall Storefront API payloads are normalized into uniform internal TypeScript models (\`lib/types.ts\`) via \`lib/fourthwall/reshape.ts\`:

\`\`\`ts
// Raw Fourthwall Product -> Reshaped Application Product
export function reshapeProduct(product: FourthwallProduct): Product {
  return {
    id: product.id,
    handle: product.slug,
    title: product.name,
    description: product.description,
    descriptionHtml: product.description,
    options: extractProductOptions(product.variants),
    variants: product.variants.map(reshapeVariant),
    images: product.images.map(reshapeImage),
    featuredImage: reshapeImage(product.images[0]),
    priceRange: calculatePriceRange(product.variants),
    tags: extractTags(product),
    updatedAt: product.updatedAt
  };
}

## The Dual API Model

Fourthwall provides two distinct API tiers designed for separate operational roles:

| API Tier | Base Endpoint | Primary Purpose | Required Credentials |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storefront API** | \`https://storefront-api.fourthwall.com/v1\` | Public catalog browsing, product query, cart creation, checkout generation | \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN\` |
| **Platform Open API** | \`https://api.fourthwall.com/open-api/v1.0\` | Shop, product, order and payout reads. **Write support is limited to a print-on-demand design pipeline — it cannot create a priced physical product.** | \`FOURTHWALL_ACCESS_TOKEN\`, or Basic Auth with \`FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME\`/\`FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD\` |

---

## Storefront API (v1)

Used directly by the storefront client to query data:

### Endpoints Used in Storefront:
- \`GET /collections\`: Fetches all published collections.
- \`GET /collections/{handle}/products\`: Returns products in a collection filtered by currency.
- \`GET /products/{handle}\`: Returns a single product with full variant tree.
- \`POST /carts\`: Initializes a new persistent cart session.
- \`GET /carts/{id}\`: Retrieves an existing cart by ID.
- \`POST /carts/{id}/add\`: Adds merchandise items to an existing cart.
- \`POST /carts/{id}/change\`: Updates item quantities or variants.
- \`POST /carts/{id}/remove\`: Removes line items.
- \`GET /shop\`: Returns shop metadata and public checkout domains.

---

## Platform Open API (v1.0)

Read by \`lib/fourthwall/importer.ts\` and \`scripts/import-artworks-to-fourthwall.ts\` to report live shop state.

### ⚠️ The write path is not supported

**Fourthwall exposes no endpoint that creates a physical product with an explicit price and variant list.**

\`POST /open-api/v1.0/products\` is a print-on-demand **design pipeline**. It requires \`productTemplateId\` and \`regions[]\` (each region referencing a registered media \`imageId\`), plus \`name\` and \`type\` (design / digital / customization — not \`physical\`). The optional fields are \`colors[]\`, \`sizes[]\`, \`description\`, \`profitMargin\` and \`publishOnCreate\`.

There is **no \`price\`, \`variants\`, \`slug\`, \`stock\` or \`images\`** field in the request, and pricing is expressed as \`profitMargin\` on top of a template's base cost. Posting the payload below returns **400 regardless of credentials**.

Verified 2026-10-01 against \`https://docs.fourthwall.com/api-reference/platform/products/create-product\`.

### Intended catalogue payload (documents intent only — not accepted by any endpoint):
\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "Greetings from Austin",
  "slug": "greetings-from-austin",
  "description": "Original fine artwork Greetings from Austin by Rory Skagen...",
  "type": "physical",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "tags": ["greetings-from-austin", "mural", "texas", "Austin Iconic & Texas Pop", "Enamel"],
  "images": [
    {
      "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xjilp2pq/image/upload/v1787076996/GreetingsfromAustin.jpg",
      "width": 2100,
      "height": 1400,
      "alt": "Greetings from Austin by Rory Skagen - Enamel"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "12\" x 18\" Archival Print",
      "sku": "RS-GREETING-1",
      "price": 55.00,
      "currency": "USD",
      "inventoryType": "UNLIMITED",
      "attributes": { "size": "12\" x 18\"", "medium": "Enamel" }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

---

## Authentication Methods

Our integration supports three distinct authentication schemes depending on your configuration:

1. **Bearer Token (Recommended for Service Accounts):**
   \`\`\`http
   Authorization: Bearer <FOURTHWALL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
   \`\`\`
2. **Basic Authentication (API Key + Secret):**
   \`\`\`http
   Authorization: Basic base64(<FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME>:<FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD>)
   \`\`\`
3. **Storefront Header:**
   \`\`\`http
   X-Storefront-Token: <NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN>
   \`\`\`

---

## Cart & Checkout Lifecycle

Cart sessions are stored in an encrypted HTTP-only cookie keyed to the storefront token:
\`\`\`ts
// components/cart/actions.ts
const tokenHash = cleanEnv(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN) || 'default';
const cookieStore = await cookies();
cookieStore.set(\`\${tokenHash}/cartId\`, cartId);
\`\`\`

When a customer clicks **Proceed to Checkout**, they are redirected to Fourthwall's hosted, secure checkout domain (\`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT\` or \`shop.roryskagen.com\`).

## Source System Analysis

The source artwork catalog was located in the repository **\`https://github.com/roryskagenart/roryskagenart.com\`**, a Next.js / Express web application using a **Supabase PostgreSQL database** and a media asset pipeline distributed across **Cloudinary** and **Supabase Storage**.

Key source files identified and parsed:
- \`data/archive/portfolioPostsData.updated.json\`: 137 raw catalog entries containing titles, dates, mediums, dimensions, and Cloudinary URLs.
- \`supabase/migrations/2026_09_13_cms_v2_source_of_truth_backfill.sql\`: Full narrative descriptions and historical notes for each artwork.
- \`src/data/assetRegistry.ts\`: 1MB asset registry containing optimized WebP rendition links hosted on Supabase public buckets.

---

## Extraction & Normalization

We executed an automated ingestion script that merged the structured metadata from \`portfolioPostsData.updated.json\` with the rich narrative text extracted from the SQL backfill migration.

### Transformation Rules Applied:
1. **Title & Slugs:** Canonical database slugs preserved (e.g. \`greetings-from-austin\`, \`gianondor\`, \`austin-2019\`).
2. **Series Classification:** Mapped each item's series into store collection handles:
   - *Monsters & Kaiju* → \`monsters-kaiju\`
   - *Austin Iconic & Texas Pop* → \`austin-iconic\`
   - *Pop Surrealism & Folklore* → \`pop-surrealism\`
   - *Atomic Pop & Sci-Fi* → \`atomic-sci-fi\`
   - All pieces also belong to \`all\`.
3. **Launch Selection:** 13 flagship pieces (including the Austin mural, Skyline, Godzilla, and giant Kaiju) were assigned to the \`launch\` collection to power the homepage hero and carousel.
4. **Description Formatting:** Stripped markdown frontmatter and obsidian wiki-links (\`[[...]]\`) to generate clean, customer-facing product descriptions.
5. **Pricing Matrix:** Computed tier-based pricing based on original artwork dimensions:
   - Standard pieces: $45 USD base.
   - Large-scale / mural works (e.g. 3.5ft × 5ft): $55 USD base.

---

## Media Asset Resolution

Each artwork's primary image was validated for availability. Both Cloudinary and Supabase media hosts respond with HTTP 200:
- Cloudinary: \`https://res.cloudinary.com/xjilp2pq/image/upload/...\`
- Supabase: \`https://orphcusijzkxpxkzapjp.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/artwork-images/...\`

Both hosts have been configured in \`next.config.js\` under \`images.remotePatterns\` to permit Next.js image optimization.

---

## Canonical JSON Schema

The resulting artifact is stored in **\`lib/fourthwall/rory-artworks-data.json\`**. Structure of each entry:

\`\`\`ts
interface RoryArtworkData {
  id: string;             // e.g. "rory-gianondor"
  slug: string;           // e.g. "gianondor"

## Running the CLI Tool

We created a dedicated CLI runner located in \`scripts/import-artworks-to-fourthwall.ts\`. You can execute it directly via npm:

\`\`\`bash
# Run dry-run validation (no API writes)
npm run import:fourthwall -- --dry-run

# Run full live sync with active Fourthwall credentials
npm run import:fourthwall

# Process a small test batch (e.g. 5 artworks)
npm run import:fourthwall -- --limit=5
\`\`\`

---

## CLI Options & Flags

| Flag | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| \`--dry-run\` | Boolean | Runs full payload generation and schema validation without making network writes to Fourthwall. |
| \`--limit=<n>\` | Number | Restricts the sync run to the first \`<n>\` items (useful for testing single items or rate limits). |
| \`--slug=<slug>\` | String | Syncs a specific single artwork by slug (e.g. \`--slug=greetings-from-austin\`). |

---

## REST API Endpoints

The web application exposes a dedicated internal API route at **\`/api/import/fourthwall\`**:

### 1. Catalog Status & Health Check
\`\`\`http
GET /api/import/fourthwall
\`\`\`
**Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "summary": {
    "totalArtworks": 137,
    "seriesBreakdown": {
      "Austin Iconic & Texas Pop": 11,
      "Monsters & Kaiju": 34,
      "Pop Surrealism & Folklore": 87,
      "Atomic Pop & Sci-Fi": 5
    },
    "credentialsStatus": {
      "apiUrl": "https://storefront-api.fourthwall.com",
      "hasStorefrontToken": true,
      "hasPlatformCredentials": false
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Triggering Sync via HTTP
\`\`\`http
POST /api/import/fourthwall
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "dryRun": true,
  "limit": 10
}
\`\`\`

---

## CSV & Open API Exports

For merchants who prefer importing via Fourthwall's dashboard or third-party bulk tools:

- **Download Fourthwall Product CSV:**
  \`\`\`http
  GET /api/import/fourthwall?format=csv
  \`\`\`
  Generates a standard CSV with handles, titles, HTML descriptions, option sizes, prices, and high-res image sources.

- **Download Open API JSON:**
  \`\`\`http
  GET /api/import/fourthwall?format=fourthwall-json
  \`\`\`
  Returns a pre-formatted JSON array ready for direct ingestion via Fourthwall's Platform API batch endpoints.

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Scope | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_API_URL\` | Client & Server | Yes | Base URL for Fourthwall Storefront API (\`https://storefront-api.fourthwall.com/v1\`). |
| \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN\` | Client & Server | Yes | Storefront token provided in your Fourthwall dashboard developer settings. |
| \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_COLLECTION\` | Client & Server | No | Default collection for the homepage grid and carousel (defaults to \`launch\` or \`all\`). |
| \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT\` | Client & Server | No | Custom domain or fallback checkout domain (\`https://shop.roryskagen.com\`). |
| \`FOURTHWALL_PLATFORM_API_URL\` | Server Only | No | Platform API host for product writes. Defaults to \`https://api.fourthwall.com\`. **Distinct from \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_API_URL\`** — the Platform host must never be derived from the Storefront host. |
| \`FOURTHWALL_ACCESS_TOKEN\` | Server Only | Optional | Bearer access token for Fourthwall Platform API write operations. |
| \`FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME\` | Server Only | Optional | Basic auth username for the Fourthwall Platform API. **Preferred name — this is what Vercel provisions.** |
| \`FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD\` | Server Only | Optional | Basic auth password for the Fourthwall Platform API. **Preferred name — this is what Vercel provisions.** |
| \`FOURTHWALL_API_KEY\` | Server Only | Optional | Legacy alias for \`FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME\`. Consulted only when the preferred name is unset. |
| \`FOURTHWALL_API_SECRET\` | Server Only | Optional | Legacy alias for \`FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD\`. Consulted only when the preferred name is unset. |
| \`FOURTHWALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET\` | Server Only | Optional | Secret key to verify incoming Fourthwall webhook event signatures. |
| \`IMPORT_ADMIN_USER\` | Server Only | Yes | Basic auth username gating \`/import\` and \`/api/import/fourthwall\`. Unset in production returns 503. |
| \`IMPORT_ADMIN_PASSWORD\` | Server Only | Yes | Basic auth password gating \`/import\` and \`/api/import/fourthwall\`. Unset in production returns 503. |

## Environment Variable Sanitization

Environment variables imported from external tools often include surrounding quotes or inline comments (e.g. \`"value" # comment\`). To prevent parsing failures, all environment variables pass through \`cleanEnv()\` in \`lib/utils.ts\`:

\`\`\`ts
// lib/utils.ts
export function cleanEnv(value: string | undefined): string {
  if (!value) return '';
  let cleaned = value.trim();
  if (cleaned.includes(' #')) {
    cleaned = cleaned.split(' #')[0]!.trim();
  }
  if ((cleaned.startsWith('"') && cleaned.endsWith('"')) ||
      (cleaned.startsWith("'") && cleaned.endsWith("'"))) {
    cleaned = cleaned.slice(1, -1).trim();
  }
  return cleaned;
}
\`\`\`

---

## Next.js Remote Image Whitelisting

Next.js strict Image Optimization blocks remote image URLs unless explicitly registered in \`next.config.js\`. The following domains are whitelisted:

\`\`\`js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    remotePatterns: [
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: '*.fourthwall.com' },
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: '*.fourthwall.dev' },
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'images.unsplash.com' },
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'res.cloudinary.com' },
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: '*.supabase.co' }
    ]
  }
};
\`\`\`

---

## Secrets Security Best Practices

1. **Never prefix private keys with \`NEXT_PUBLIC_\`**: Only public storefront tokens and API URLs should carry the \`NEXT_PUBLIC_\` prefix.
2. **Platform write credentials must remain server-side**: \`FOURTHWALL_ACCESS_TOKEN\`, \`FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME\` and \`FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD\` are read only from the deployment environment inside server-side code (\`lib/fourthwall/importer.ts\`, \`app/api/import/fourthwall/route.ts\`) and CLI scripts. They are never accepted from a request body or entered in the UI.

    content: `
## Compilation & Build Pipeline

The project compiles with Next.js 15 App Router and standalone output mode:

\`\`\`bash
# Production optimized build
npm run build
\`\`\`

- **Standalone Output:** Configured with \`output: 'standalone'\` in \`next.config.js\`. This creates a lightweight self-contained server bundle in \`.next/standalone\` optimized for Docker containers, Google Cloud Run, and Kubernetes.
- **Turbopack Compiler:** Next.js 15 uses Turbopack for near-instant hot module replacement and build compilation.

---

## Linting & Static Analysis

Linting is enforced with TypeScript typechecking in \`package.json\`:

\`\`\`bash
# Run TypeScript static analysis
npm run lint
\`\`\`

Runs \`tsc --noEmit\` against the entire project tree, verifying route types, prop interfaces, and Fourthwall DTO contracts.

---

## Running Test Suites

Vitest is configured for unit and integration testing:

\`\`\`bash
# Run test suite once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
\`\`\`

---

## Production Deployment Guide

### Option A: Vercel (Native)
1. Push codebase to GitHub or connect repository.
2. Vercel automatically detects Next.js 15 and configures Edge Middleware and Serverless Functions.
3. Define required environment variables in the Vercel Project Settings:
   - \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_API_URL\`
   - \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN\`
   - \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT\`

### Option B: Docker / Container Platforms (Cloud Run / AWS ECS)
1. The \`output: 'standalone'\` build creates \`.next/standalone/server.js\`.
2. Package with Node.js 22 LTS container.
3. Expose port 3000 (\`PORT=3000\`).
4. Execute \`node .next/standalone/server.js\`.

## Tri-Domain Architecture Topology

The Rory Skagen digital ecosystem spans three coordinated web surfaces that require visual harmony and congruent brand identity:

1. **\`roryskagenart.com\`** (Main Artist Portfolio & CMS):
   - Built with Next.js, Supabase PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS.
   - Hosts full biographical records, mural maps, press archives, and studio narratives.
2. **\`roryskagenart.fourthwall.com\`** (Fourthwall Hosted Creator Store):
   - Fourthwall's direct multitenant hosted ecommerce platform.
   - Handles merchant backend, physical fulfillment, customer support, and sales taxes.
3. **\`shop.roryskagenart.com\`** (Custom Domain Production Storefront):
   - This application — custom headless storefront powered by Next.js 15, Tailwind, and Fourthwall Storefront APIs.
   - Provides an omnichannel experience linking back to the portfolio while facilitating checkout through Fourthwall.

---

## Step 1: Low-Risk Visual Propagation (Current Scope)

The mandate for Step 1 is to achieve a **super basic, low-risk, congruent brand experience** with zero disruption to checkout flows or core ecommerce stability.

### Assets & Visual Elements Propagated:
- **Official Brand Icon:** Migrated from \`roryskagenart.com/android-chrome-192x192.png\` to \`/public/android-chrome-192x192.png\`. Used across the top navigation, mobile drawers, and footer brand lockup.
- **Favicon Family:** Deployed \`favicon-32x32.png\`, \`favicon-16x16.png\`, \`apple-touch-icon.png\`, and \`site.webmanifest\` matching the studio portfolio exactly.
- **Brand Typography Lockup:**
  - Primary title: **"Rory Skagen Art"** (\`tracking-[0.18em] uppercase font-black font-serif\`).
  - Studio metadata: **"Austin, Texas • Est. 1985"** (\`tracking-[0.22em] text-neutral-500 font-mono\`).
- **Footer Attribution:** Direct reciprocal link to the \`roryskagenart.com\` portfolio, ensuring visitors can move between the fine art catalog and the studio's broader biography.

---

## Feature Flag Architecture (BRAND_CONFIG)

To ensure this visual propagation is **100% reversible, non-breaking, and isolated**, all brand elements are governed by the centralized configuration in **\`lib/brand-config.ts\`**:

\`\`\`ts
// lib/brand-config.ts
export const BRAND_CONFIG = {
  name: 'Rory Skagen Art',
  tagline: 'Austin, Texas • Est. 1985',
  domains: {
    portfolio: 'https://roryskagenart.com',
    fourthwallHosted: 'https://roryskagenart.fourthwall.com',
    shopCustomDomain: 'https://shop.roryskagenart.com'
  },
  features: {
    // Controlled via NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_BRAND_V1 env var (defaults to true)
    brandExperienceV1: cleanEnv(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_BRAND_V1) !== 'false',

    // Future feature flags (disabled in Step 1)
    crossDomainSso: false,
    omnichannelGlobalHeader: false,
    realtimePaletteSync: false,
    arRoomPreview: false
  }
};
\`\`\`

If \`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_BRAND_V1="false"\` is set, components seamlessly degrade to standard generic defaults with zero runtime exceptions.

---

## Step 2: Future Release Features Plan

For upcoming releases beyond the basic visual propagation scope, the following capabilities have been planned and architected:

### 1. Unified Omnichannel Header (Release v1.2.0)
- **Goal:** Render identical header navigation across \`roryskagenart.com\` and \`shop.roryskagenart.com\` with cross-domain cart badge synchronization.
- **Mechanism:** Cross-subdomain shared cookie (\`domain=.roryskagenart.com\`) tracking the active Fourthwall cart count so visitors on the portfolio site see their shopping cart counter update in real time.

### 2. Cross-Domain Collector Single Sign-On (Release v1.3.0)
- **Goal:** Unify portfolio user profiles with Fourthwall supporter accounts.
- **Mechanism:** OAuth 2.0 / JWT session exchange allowing authenticated studio members to access exclusive print drops and view past Fourthwall orders within their portfolio profile.

### 3. Real-Time Palette & CMS Synchronization (Release v1.4.0)
- **Goal:** Allow the artist to update seasonal theme palettes (e.g. "Neon Sunset", "Atomic Sage") in the Supabase CMS and automatically update the Fourthwall storefront.
- **Mechanism:** Supabase Database Webhook triggering Next.js on-demand revalidation to regenerate root CSS variables.

### 4. Augmented Reality (AR) "View in Your Room" (Release v1.5.0)
- **Goal:** Allow collectors to preview original enamel paintings and large-scale canvas pieces in 1:1 true scale on their own walls.
- **Mechanism:** WebXR and Apple Quick Look (\`.usdz\`) models generated from high-resolution artwork aspect ratios and original dimensions.
