# Fourthwall Product Catalog — Pull, Map & Generate

Turn "what can I actually sell on Fourthwall?" into a measured, reproducible catalog plus the
artifacts a launcher tool validates against. The whole catalog is **public** — no login, no storefront
token — so this works read-only with zero credentials.

**Core rule: the catalog number has an expiry date.** It was **605** on 2026-10-02 (measured, 25 pages,
0 failures). Fourthwall adds templates constantly; a "605" claim becomes a lie the moment the set grows.
Re-pull before you assert a denominator. See §6.

## 0. When to use

- You are building or validating a **products-launcher** (pick a template → attach art → create a
  sellable product) and need the full template set, not just what `roryskagenart` already published.
- You need the admin gallery filters (Categories, Collections, Colors, Base price, Production method,
  Print regions, Brands) reconciled against real API fields.
- You need to regenerate `catalog_full.csv`, `catalog_summary.json`, or `fourthwall-full-catalog.md`.
- You are writing a create payload and must avoid the `regionId` vs `placementId` trap.

## 1. What you get (canonical snapshot)

All four live under this skill's `references/`. Treat the first three as the **source of truth** for the
launcher's catalog ingest; the launcher's acceptance test re-derives them and must match.

| Artifact | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`catalog_full.csv`](references/catalog_full.csv) | **All 605 templates × every attribute** (name, productId, top/sub category, brand, productionMethod, basePrice, priceFrom/To, numColors, colors, regions, placements, minOrders, supportsBackendRendering). |
| [`catalog_summary.json`](references/catalog_summary.json) | Facet roll-ups: top categories, 47 sub-categories, 10 production methods, 47 brands, price min/avg/max, 544 distinct colors, 91 region ids, 17 placement ids, min-orders. |
| [`fourthwall-full-catalog.md`](references/fourthwall-full-catalog.md) | Human-readable facet map + the admin-gallery → API field mapping (§0) + create-vs-read-only notes. |
| [`product-create-schema.md`](references/product-create-schema.md) | The **create** schema — product meta and config fields, measured from the Platform API. |

For the two-API architecture and the live write surface, read
[`../../stack/fourthwall.md`](../../stack/fourthwall.md) and
[`../../../../lib/fourthwall/AGENTS.md`](../../../../lib/fourthwall/AGENTS.md) first.

## 2. The two APIs (refresher)

| API | Base | Auth | Use here |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storefront** | `storefront-api.fourthwall.com/v1` | publishable token as `?storefront_token=` | Reads published products only — **not** the template catalog. |
| **Platform (Open API)** | `api.fourthwall.com/open-api/v1.0` | Basic `FOURTHWALL_API_USERNAME`/`FOURTHWALL_API_PASSWORD` | Template catalog (read) **and** product create (write). |

The catalog pull in §3 uses **Platform**, read-only, and works **without** Basic auth (the endpoint is
public). Auth only matters at create time.

---

## 3. Phase 0 — Pull the full catalog (public, no auth)

`GET /product-templates` is **path-paginated**, 25 per page, 1-indexed:

```
GET https://api.fourthwall.com/open-api/v1.0/product-templates/page/1
… up to /page/25   # 605 total → 25 pages (last page has 5)
```

Traps that cost a false "25" reading:

- **Query params are ignored.** `?size=600&page=1` does nothing — the API always returns 25 and reads
  the page from the **path**. The `total` field is the real count.
- **Responses are gzip-compressed.** Pass `--compressed` to curl, or you get binary.
- A reverse proxy may sit in front of the host in some environments; the public endpoint returned the
  same 605 with and without shop auth, so auth is not the filter.

`references/pull-catalog.sh` does the full 25-page pull (list + per-template detail) and writes
`catalog_list.json` + `catalog_details.json`. It is idempotent and read-only. Run it from repo root
after sourcing `.env.local` only if you later need auth-gated fields (you don't, for the catalog).

---

## 4. Phase 1 — Generate the artifacts

`references/analyze_catalog.py` reads `catalog_list.json` + `catalog_details.json` and emits the three
artifacts. It filters `None` region/price values defensively (the API omits `priceFrom` on some
templates). Outputs:

- `catalog_full.csv` — one row per template, pipe-delimited multi-values (`colors`, `regions`).
- `catalog_summary.json` — the roll-up in §1.
- `fourthwall-full-catalog.md` — the facet map.

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Map admin "create product" gallery → API

Full table in `references/fourthwall-full-catalog.md` §0. Summary:

| Admin facet | API field | In API? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Categories (Apparel/Accessories/Drinkware/Home & Living) | `category` (top) | ✅ 421/126/30/28 |
| Sub-categories (T-Shirts, Mugs, Wall Art, …) | `category` (after `/`) | ✅ 47 |
| Production method | `productionMethod` | ✅ 10 |
| Brands (Champion, Stanley/Stella, …) | `brand` | ✅ 47 |
| Colors | `colorVariants[].color.name` | ✅ 544 |
| Base price | `basePrice` / `priceFrom`–`priceTo` | ✅ $1.21–$70.50 |
| Print regions | `customizableAreas[].regionId` | ✅ 91 |
| Min. orders | `minimumOrdersNumber` | ⚠️ all 0 — non-discriminating |
| Collections (Eco-Friendly, Budget friendly, Signature, Streetwear, Seasonal, Wellness) | — | ❌ curated UI labels, no field |
| Special features / How quickly / Ships from | — | ❌ not in API |

**Bottom line:** every *filter* is backed by a real attribute except the three curated UI labels. You
cannot query Collections server-side — group client-side from the attributes above (e.g. All-Over Prints
= `ALL_OVER_PRINT`, Gaming = a sub-category, Knitwear = `KNITTING`, Champion = a brand).

---

## 6. Phase 3 — Validate a launch (create) payload

The launcher creates a **design** product: `POST /products` with `type:"design"` + `productTemplateId`
(from this catalog) + `regions[{region, imageId, placementStrategy}]` + optional `colors`, `sizes`,
`profitMargin`, `publishOnCreate`. Grounded in `lib/fourthwall/merch.ts`:

- **`regions[].region` must equal a `regionId` from the template's `customizableAreas`** — NOT a
  placement id (`leftChest`, `largeCenter`, …). This is the single most common create failure.
  (`merch.ts:171` documents it; `scripts/publish-merch-to-fourthwall.ts:185` enforces it.)
- **`profitMargin` is USD added on top of base, not a percentage and not a final price.**
  Use `profitMarginForTarget(targetPrice, basePrice)` (`merch.ts:232`) to convert a retail target.
- **`publishOnCreate` defaults to `false`** (`merch.ts:185`, `:216`) — products are created hidden.
- **Art minimums:** `FOURTHWALL_MIN_ACCEPTED_PX = 1500` (`merch.ts:27`); transparency required for
  `DTG`, `DTFX`, `EMBROIDERY` (`FOURTHWALL_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED_METHODS`, `merch.ts:38`).
- **Never resolve a template by name** — pin `productTemplateId`. The catalog's `productId` is the id.
- **`unitPrice` is a decimal dollar amount, not cents** (`lib/fourthwall/AGENTS.md:20`).
- **Cache-bust before asserting on a live read** — the CDN caches per exact URL
  (`lib/fourthwall/AGENTS.md:58`).

⚠️ **Never probe an unknown HTTP method against a live product/collection id.** A stray `DELETE` once
soft-deleted a real product. Probe a scratch record or read the docs. (AGENTS.md rule #5.)

---

## 7. Traps learned the hard way

- ⚠️ **"25 templates" is page 1, not the catalog.** Path pagination; trust `total`.
- ⚠️ **gzip**: curl without `--compressed` yields binary, not JSON.
- ⚠️ **`regionId` ≠ `placementId`.** The catalog exposes both; create wants the region.
- ⚠️ **Denominator expiry**: 605 was measured 2026-10-02. Re-pull before citing the count or any
  fraction (e.g. "441/605 have multiple colors").
- ⚠️ **`minimumOrdersNumber` is 0 for all 605** — do not use it as a filter or a signal.
- ⚠️ **Collections are not queryable** — derive client-side or drop them.

---

## 8. Reproduce (human-runnable)

```bash
# from repo root
bash docs/agentic/skills/fourthwall-product-catalog/references/pull-catalog.sh   # 25-page read-only pull
python docs/agentic/skills/fourthwall-product-catalog/references/analyze_catalog.py  # emit the 3 artifacts
```

No credentials required for the pull. `pull-catalog.sh` writes `catalog_list.json` /
`catalog_details.json` to its working dir; `analyze_catalog.py` reads those and writes the artifacts
next to them (redirect or copy into `references/`).
