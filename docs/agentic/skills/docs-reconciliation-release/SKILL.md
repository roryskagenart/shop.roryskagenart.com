# Docs Reconciliation & Docs-Only Release

Cut a low-risk, documentation-only minor release that makes the repo's docs match
**verified reality** — real commits, real file paths, real config. The deliverable is
trustworthy context for the next contributor or agent, not new features.

**Core rule: verify every claim against the code before writing it down.** The whole
point is to eliminate stale assertions. Never copy a claim from an existing doc into a
new one without checking it, and never fabricate a commit hash, deploy URL, or metric.

## When to use

- Docs are stale, contradictory, or written by a different team/agent.
- The user wants a "consolidation", "cleanup", or docs-only minor release before new work.
- Preparing a verified baseline before a big migration (e.g. a data merge).
- Refactoring a `plan/`, `docs/`, or `specs/` directory.

## Procedure

### 1. Establish ground truth first
```bash
git status --short          # uncommitted work
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git log -1 --oneline        # current HEAD
git tag                     # existing tags (naming convention)
git log --oneline -30       # recent history
```
Note the working-tree state: is it clean? Are there untracked files? This determines
what you can safely touch.

### 2. Inventory the documentation surface
List every doc: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the
whole spec directory. Read them. Note contradictions and claims that need checking.

### 3. Verify claims — the actual work
For every non-trivial assertion in the docs, check it against the code:

- **Stale vendor / dependency references:** `git grep -in "<vendor>"` (scoped with
  `':!node_modules'` etc.). Distinguish *live* references (must fix) from *provenance*
  (historical records, changelogs, archives — leave alone).
- **File paths mentioned:** confirm they exist (`ls`, `Glob`). Watch for entrypoint
  renames (e.g. `api/index.cjs` vs `api/index.js`).
- **Commit hashes:** `git cat-file -t <hash>` to confirm each cited commit exists.
- **Env var names:** match against `.env.example` exactly.
- **Counts and versions:** re-derive them (grep counts, `git tag`, dependency lists).
  Mark any number you cannot re-verify as "re-verify before relying on this".

### 4. Write the canonical context doc
Create/refresh a single authoritative doc (commonly `AGENTS.md`) holding: project
identity, verified stack table, authoritative env vars, the DB write path, the current
schema, a repo map, and conventions/guardrails. Have it explicitly state that it
**supersedes** historical specs.

### 5. Status-index the spec directory
Add a `<specs>/README.md` with a status table: each doc, its status
(Implemented / Superseded / Planned), what it covers, and the commit that delivered it.
Flip each spec's own header status too — but **do not rewrite the spec body**; specs
are frozen at implementation. Mark superseded specs with a clear banner, keep them.

### 6. Promote the CHANGELOG
Move `[Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with a `> Delivered by commits:` record
citing the real hashes and the baseline version. Document work that was previously
listed as "planned" but is actually shipped.

### 7. Quarantine orphans (carefully)
For files with zero importers (verify with a repo-wide search), move them to an archive
dir. **Check tracked status first:** `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`. If tracked,
use `git mv` (preserves history, records a rename); a plain `mv` loses it. Add a short
provenance `README.md` in the archive explaining what each file is.

### 8. Validate
```bash
npm run lint      # or tsc --noEmit / equivalent typecheck
npm test          # if an offline suite exists
```
A docs-only change must not break these. Record the exact evidence (e.g. "64/64
passing") in the CHANGELOG so the release is auditable.

**Then confirm the gate itself actually ran.** A runner that silently mis-runs is worse than no
gate: it reports a number that is real but is not about your change, and the failure looks like a
broken test rather than a broken runner. Before trusting a green *or* red result, check that the
runner's own banner agrees with the path you think you are in, and that the count of tests
executed matches the count that exist.

Measured 2026-10-06: on Windows, a lowercase drive letter in `process.cwd()` (`c:\…`, because the
shell had been entered as `/c/…`) made Vitest derive a `root` whose path casing differed from the
module paths the runner itself used. Node caches modules by **path string**, so two `vitest`
instances loaded — `vi.spyOn` kept working, `vi.mock` silently stopped being hoisted, and 4 files
/ 23 tests failed with `vi.mocked(...).mockResolvedValue is not a function`. **The identical
command passed** when the working directory happened to be entered with an uppercase drive letter,
which is how it survives unnoticed. Fix the root, not the test — canonicalise it
(`root: fs.realpathSync.native(__dirname)` for Vitest; a no-op off Windows). See
[`../../traps/register.md`](../../traps/register.md#t44).

Two transferable habits from that:
- **When a failure's source is byte-identical to the committed version, stop debugging the test.**
  Prove it first (`git hash-object <f>` vs `git rev-parse HEAD:<f>`), then look at how the runner
  was started.
- **Read the runner's banner.** It names the root it actually resolved — a mismatch there is the
  defect, and it costs one line to check.

Also **verify every internal doc link resolves** — this routinely surfaces real defects
(wrong filenames, links to files that never existed). For each markdown link, resolve it
relative to the doc's directory and assert the target exists:
```bash
for f in $(git ls-files '*.md'); do d=$(dirname "$f");
  grep -oE '\]\(\.\.?/[^)#]+' "$f" | sed 's/](//' | while read -r l; do
    [ -e "$d/$l" ] || echo "MISS $f -> $l"; done; done
```
Fix any misses, then re-run until it prints nothing.

### 9. Commit and tag
Conventional commit, `docs:` type (or `feat:`/`fix:`/`test:` when the release is not docs-only),
body grouped by Added / Changed / Removed, ending with the validation line. Split into logical
commits rather than one blob — a reviewer should be able to read them in order.

If the release is local-only, stop here with an **annotated** tag. If it ships, go to §10.

### 10. Ship it through a PR (when the user wants dev/preview/prod safety)
Never push straight to the default branch. Full flow:

```bash
export GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0
GIT='git -c credential.helper='            # see environment pitfalls below

$GIT push origin main:refs/heads/release/x.y.z   # create the REMOTE branch
gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo> --base main --head release/x.y.z --title '...' --body-file -
gh pr checks <n> --watch --interval 15          # wait for preview/security gates
gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus --jq '{mergeable,mergeStateStatus}'
gh pr merge <n> --merge                         # only when mergeStateStatus is CLEAN
gh api -X DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs/heads/release/x.y.z
```

**`gh` may be unauthenticated in the shell even though git works.** If `gh auth status` says "not
logged into any GitHub hosts" but the `origin` remote URL embeds a PAT, derive the token and pass it
per-command. Never echo it.
```bash
TOKEN=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#https://[^:]+:([^@]+)@.*#\1#')
GH_TOKEN="$TOKEN" gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo> ...
```
Pass `--repo <owner>/<repo>` explicitly on every `gh` call — without a stored login there is no
default repo context. `gh` may also be off `PATH` in Git Bash; call it by absolute path.

**Merge with `--merge`, not `--squash`**, when the repo's prior release tags point at merge commits
(see the tag-placement check below). Squashing would change the shape of the release history.

**Check whether the repo even has CI.** `ls .github/workflows/` may be empty — in that case the
"checks" are third-party apps (Vercel, Socket Security, Debricked, Dependabot). A Vercel `pass`
means the app actually built, so it is a real signal; still wait for it. Poll with
`gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup` filtering for `IN_PROGRESS`/`PENDING` rather than
`--watch`, which can hang.

**Branch cleanup is a convention question, not a rule.** Deleting the release branch after merge is
common (the previous release's branch was already gone), but **ask before deleting** — some users
want the branch kept for reference. If you already deleted it, restore it with
`$GIT push origin <tip-sha>:refs/heads/release/x.y.z`.

Then sync local and cut the tag/release:
```bash
$GIT fetch origin main
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD                 # do NOT rely on origin/main (see below)
```

**Decide where the tag goes before creating it** — the merge commit, or the pre-merge tip? Check the
previous release:
```bash
git rev-parse v<prev>^{commit}    # compare against that release's merge sha
```
If they match, the repo tags **merge commits** — tag `FETCH_HEAD`, not your pre-merge tip. Getting
this wrong publishes a tag that isn't on the default branch's history.

```bash
git tag -a x.y.z -F - <merge-sha> <<'EOF' ... EOF
TAGSHA=$(git rev-parse x.y.z)
$GIT push origin "$TAGSHA:refs/tags/x.y.z"  # push the TAG OBJECT by sha
gh release create x.y.z --verify-tag --repo <owner>/<repo> --title '...' --notes-file -
```

`mergeStateStatus: UNSTABLE` means **do not merge yet** — but it does *not* reliably mean "a check is
still running". Measured 2026-09-15: all five checks reported `pass` while the state read `UNSTABLE`,
because the last check (Debricked) had *just* completed; it flipped to `CLEAN` on a re-query ~30 s
later. So **re-query before concluding anything** — never treat one `UNSTABLE` read as a failed gate,
and never merge on it either:

```bash
gh pr view <n> --json mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup   # re-run this; CLEAN is the go signal
```

`CLEAN` means go. If it stays `UNSTABLE` while the rollup is all-`SUCCESS`, look for a non-required
check (a bot comment/scan) rather than assuming a failure.
Verify at the end that the remote has **only** the expected branches and tags, and that
`HEAD == origin/main == the commit the tag points at`.
⚠️ Check `deleteBranchOnMerge` before tidying up: many repos leave it `false` and retain **every**
merged branch, so deleting one is a deviation from convention, not housekeeping.

### 11. Write project memory
Append a dated note to the project's memory dir; record durable facts (conventions,
versioning scheme, guardrails) in its long-term file.

## Pitfalls learned in practice

- **Parallel edits to the same file can drop a write — silently.** Batching `Edit` calls on one file
  races: each call reads, applies, writes, so the last writer wins with the base *it* read.
  **Every call still reports "Successfully edited file".** Measured: 6 edits in 2 batches of 3 → only
  3 landed. Edit one file **sequentially**, then **re-`grep` to confirm each change applied** — a doc
  release that ships half-edited is precisely the staleness this skill exists to prevent. (Parallel
  edits to *different* files are fine.)
- **On a stale checkout, `git diff` against HEAD lies about your change set.** If HEAD is an old
  branch the index holds an old tree, so a file you barely touched reads as wholly rewritten
  (measured: a 4-line change reported as **891** changed lines — indistinguishable from catastrophic
  whitespace damage, and it is not). **Measure against the intended base SHA**
  (`git diff <base-sha> --stat`), and build replacement content from `git show <base>:<path>` — never
  from the working tree. A stale working-tree file may also be a Frankenstein: your own edits present,
  other people's merged edits reverted. Editing that file ships a regression.
- **`replace_all` can miss occurrences at different indentation.** In files like
  `package-lock.json` the same key appears at two indent levels; a `replace_all` Edit may
  only match one. Re-grep after editing and fix stragglers using surrounding-line context
  so the match is unique.
- **Fix defects before publishing, not after.** If you find issues (broken links, wrong
  filenames) while the release is still local-only, fold them in with `git commit --amend`
  and re-create the tag — an unpublished tag is safe to move, and a docs-reconciliation
  release should ship self-consistent. Once pushed, never move the tag; use a new commit
  (or a patch release) instead.
- **Respect the repo's existing versioning convention.** Some repos track the version in
  `CHANGELOG.md` + tags only and keep `package.json` at `0.0.0` across every release.
  Bumping `package.json` there would *deviate* from convention — check before assuming.
- **Don't fabricate.** No invented deploy URLs or commit hashes. If a release was never
  deployed, say so; don't add a fake row to a deploy log.
- **Distinguish provenance from staleness.** A changelog or archive describing a retired
  vendor is history, not a bug. Only fix references that claim *current* state.
- **Don't rewrite spec history.** Status-flip and annotate; leave the original body.
- **Scope creep is the enemy.** This release changes docs only. If you find a code bug,
  report it — don't fix it here.

## Reviewing a previous session before it is archived

A common follow-up: "do a quick pass before this session is archived". Two failure modes recur, and
both are cheap to catch — always check for them explicitly.

- **An uncommitted deliverable is not a deliverable.** Run `git status --porcelain` first. A prior
  session will happily write a file, index it in a README, log it in memory, and *still* never commit
  it — so archiving loses it. This is the single highest-value thing to look for. Secure it (commit
  it, or at minimum surface it loudly), and say plainly that it was at risk.
- **Factual logs drift silently.** Deployment logs, release histories and "current" markers rot the
  moment nobody owns them. Compare the file's newest entry against reality, and **rebuild it from the
  source of truth — never invent rows.** The source is usually a CLI/API that carries commit SHAs:
  ```bash
  # Vercel: each deployment carries meta.githubCommitSha / githubCommitRef
  vercel ls <project> --yes --json | node -e "
  let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>{
    for (const x of JSON.parse(s).deployments.slice(0,15))
      console.log([new Date(x.createdAt).toISOString().slice(0,16),
        (x.target||'-').padEnd(10), (x.meta.githubCommitSha||'').slice(0,7),
        (x.meta.githubCommitRef||'?').padEnd(18), x.url].join('  '));
  });"
  ```
  Also move stale `(Current Active)`-style markers to the real current release, and add a short
  "how to maintain this log" note so the next session can refresh it.
- **Verify the previous session's own claims** before trusting its memory notes — it may have recorded
  conclusions it never re-checked. Re-run the greps. (In one pass, a note claimed a column the code
  "no longer uses"; re-checking showed the note itself was wrong.)
- **Check tag/branch conventions against reality, not the doc.** `git rev-parse <tag>^{commit}` for
  each recent tag reveals whether releases tag the merge commit or the pre-merge tip; a single
  outlier is a historical accident, not a convention. **Tags are immutable once pushed — never move
  one to "fix" it**; record the convention instead.
- **Do not prune branches as "cleanup" without checking intent.** A fully-merged branch may be
  deliberately retained. Ask, or leave it and flag it.

## Environment pitfalls (Windows / this machine)

These cost hours and are easy to re-trigger. Check for them before blaming the remote.

- **A Git Credential Manager helper hangs every git network command.** `git push` / `git
  ls-remote` die with SIGTERM and **no output at all**, which looks like a sandbox or network
  failure. There is a `credential.helper` pointing at `git-credential-manager.exe`; it waits for
  interactive auth even when the remote URL already embeds a token.
  **Fix:** `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git -c credential.helper= <cmd>`. Verify with
  `ls-remote` first — if that works instantly, the helper was the problem.
- **Newly created loose refs under `.git/refs/` are deleted by the environment.** This is the
  dangerous one. `git checkout -b foo` writes `.git/HEAD` but the ref file
  `.git/refs/heads/foo` disappears, so git considers the branch **unborn** and the next
  `git commit` produces a **root commit containing the entire tree** — silently destroying the
  branch's history relationship. Writing the ref by hand (`printf sha > .git/refs/heads/foo`)
  resolves at first but is deleted again moments later.
  **Fix: never create a local branch.** Commit on the default branch, then publish with
  `git push origin main:refs/heads/release/x.y.z`. That creates the remote branch without any
  local ref, and PRs work normally.
  ⚠️ **That fix assumes you are allowed to commit on the default branch.** Many repos forbid it
  ("never push `main` first" — this is often written into the repo's own release law). In that case
  build the commit object directly and push it **by SHA**; no local ref is ever written, so nothing
  can be pruned:
  ```bash
  export GIT_INDEX_FILE="C:/Users/<you>/AppData/Local/Temp/idx-x"   # a C:/ path, not /tmp
  rm -f "$GIT_INDEX_FILE"
  git read-tree <base-sha>                          # start from the INTENDED base
  for f in <files…>; do
    b=$(git hash-object -w "$f")
    git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644,$b,"$f"   # comma form; space form is deprecated
  done
  tree=$(git write-tree)
  commit=$(git commit-tree "$tree" -p <base-sha> -F <msg-file>)
  git push origin "$commit:refs/heads/<branch>"     # push BY SHA
  git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>          # verify; a zero exit is not evidence
  ```
  ⚠️ `git hash-object -w` does **not** normalise line endings unless you pass `--path`, so confirm
  with `git diff <base-sha> "$commit" --stat` before pushing — a whole-file diff means a CRLF
  problem, not a content problem. ⚠️ `git hash-object -w /tmp/...` fails in Git Bash (git cannot open
  the path); pass a `C:/…` path.
  **If you already hit it:** `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main` restores HEAD (the default
  branch ref is untouched), `git reset` unstages the bogus root commit, and the working tree is
  intact. Confirm with `git status --short` that every edit is still present.
- **`refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` is deleted after a fetch — or silently left *stale*** — and also
  after a `git push` (including `git push --delete`), so `git reset --hard origin/main` fails with
  "ambiguous argument" at surprising moments, or succeeds while pointing at an old commit. **Stale is
  the worse failure:** `git fetch` prints a textbook success
  (`9b4eb91..4946546  main -> origin/main`) and `git ls-tree -r origin/main` then shows a tree from
  *before* your merge — which reads exactly like "my merge lost a file". **`FETCH_HEAD` is
  authoritative**, as is the SHA from the API. **Fix:** `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`, then recreate
  the tracking ref by writing the file directly:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .git/refs/remotes/origin && printf '<sha>\n' > .git/refs/remotes/origin/main
  ```
  Re-check it after every network command; it is cheaper to restore than to debug a confusing
  "unknown revision" later.
- **Push tags by object SHA**, not by name: `git push origin <tag-sha>:refs/tags/<name>`. If the
  local tag ref gets deleted between `git tag` and `git push`, a by-name push fails.
- **A GitHub connector may be read-only.** If PR creation returns `403 Resource not accessible by
  integration`, use the repo's own PAT via `GH_TOKEN` and the `gh` CLI (or the REST API) instead.
  `gh` may not be on `PATH` in Git Bash — call it by absolute path
  (`"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"`), and derive `GH_TOKEN` from the remote URL when the
  Windows keyring is unreachable from the shell.

## Deliverables

1. Canonical context doc (e.g. `AGENTS.md`).
2. Spec-directory status index.
3. Reconciled `README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Quarantined orphans + archive provenance note.
5. Logical Conventional Commits (local-only, or merged via PR — see §10).
6. An annotated tag, pushed by object SHA, plus a GitHub Release when shipping.
7. Validation evidence recorded, including any **proof** you ran (not just assertions) —
   e.g. before/after diffs demonstrating a migration was a no-op.
8. Verified final remote state: default branch only, expected tags, local == remote.
